                    Hey, I am Vito, a second-year engineer currently studying at the University of Cambridge.
                    So far, I have not specialized and have covered various modules.
                    The syllabus can be found by clicking these links:
                    <a href="http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/part-ia-syllabuses-links-online-resources">First Year,</a>
                    <a href="http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/part-ib-syllabuses-links-online-resources">Second Year</a>
                    <br>
                    I plan on specializing in aeronautical engineering with a focus on fluids, where hopefully in the future, I can do some research on them. Furthermore, I intend to take up a few information modules as they provide a good basic skill set of probability and code.
                    <br>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy kayaking and climbing. If you haven't, they're brilliant sports to get into, and you get some amazing views, so I definitely recommend! On the right, there is a nice little canyoning image I had on my camera roll.
